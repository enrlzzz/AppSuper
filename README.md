# ðŸ›’ Smart Supermarket System â€“ Java Console Application

Welcome to the **Smart Supermarket System**, a simple yet powerful Java console application designed to simulate common operations in a supermarket environment. This project was built using basic Java control structures like `if`, `while`, `for`, arrays, and switch statements â€“ perfect for beginners and students looking to deepen their logic and programming fundamentals.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

This application includes seven main functionalities:

1. **Product Registration (while loop)**  
   Register products one by one until the user types `"fim"`.

2. **Automatic Price Adjustment (array + for loop)**  
   Takes 5 product prices and increases them by 10%.

3. **Shopping Cart Simulation (while loop)**  
   Adds product prices until the total exceeds R$100. Useful to simulate cart limits.

4. **Promo Code Verification (do-while loop)**  
   Validates a promotional code input using a `do-while` structure.

5. **Progressive Discount (array)**  
   Applies a 10% discount to 5 customer purchases.

6. **Purchase Amount Sorting (array + sort)**  
   Sorts 6 purchase amounts in ascending order.

7. **Sum by Category (array + conditional logic)**  
   Registers 10 products and categorizes their values, summing totals for:
   - Food
   - Hygiene
   - Beverage
   - Cleaning
   - Other
